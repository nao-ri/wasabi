# PLDI 2019 Tutorial: Dynamically Analyzing WebAssembly with Wasabi

We offered a tutorial on how to use Wasabi for dynamically analyzing WebAssembly at [PLDI 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2019).
Although the conference is now over, all the material is online at http://wasabi.software-lab.org/tutorial-pldi2019/.
In particular, the [slides are available here](http://wasabi.software-lab.org/wasabi_tutorial_slides.pdf) and the data for the hands-on tasks is in this directory.

See the respective subdirectories for instructions and input files.

## Task 0: Creating WebAssembly Programs

## Task 1: Your First Wasabi Analysis

## Task 2: Building a Call-Graph

## Task 3: Simple Reverse Engineering

Taken from WABT's test suite at https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/test/binary.
All test binaries contain the "name" custom section, with different name subsections (module, function, local names)
Generated by running `<wabt repo>/test/run-tests.py binary/*name* -p` (selecting only name tests, printing intermediate commands for finding produced .wasm files).
